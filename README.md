## Atif
Atif is an advanced theoretical tool for inhomogenous fluids. Atif can be used to study many kinds of fluids near an interface:
* hard sphere fluids with size symmetry/asymmetry 
* electrolytes including size symmetry/asymmetry and monovalent/multivalent ions
* flexible and semiflexible uncharged/charged polymers (polyelectrolytes)
* block uncharged/charged polymers and sequential uncharged/charged polymers

Currently, this theoretical tool is only for open systems (Grand-canonical ensemble). Howerver, it is very easy to make use of this tool to study issues in a closed system (canonical ensemble). In addition, the current version can only study the inhomogeneous properties near a **planar surface**. 

In the future, we would also like to involve **spherical** and **cylindrical interfaces**.

## The theories we used in this tool

**I, self-consistent field theory** 
* the flexible polymer is modeled by freely jointed chain model
* the semiflexible polymer is modeled using discrete worm-like chain model
* the excluded volume effect is treated using local incompressible condition
* the electrosatic potenital is obtained using point charge model.

**II, density functional theory**
* the flexible polymer is modeled by freely jointed chain model
* the semiflexible polymer is modeled using discrete worm-like chain model;
* the excluded volume effect is involved using modified fundamental measure theory
* the electrostatic potential is obtained using truncated shell model
* the electrostatic correlations are involved using a functional mean spherical approximation (MSA)
* the non-bonded chain connectivtiy contirbutions are considered using thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT)

I will cite the corresponding references subsequently.
